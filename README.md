## Stock Prediction Algorithm using Sentiment Analysis
This study introduces a comprehensive stock prediction algorithm. It combines sentiment analysis with quantitative financial modeling to predict market trends. Powered
by advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, Sentiment Analysis assesses the sentiment of financial news. Social media posts, earnings, and investor comments These sentiment scores are combined with historical stock data such as price,
volume, and technical indicators.
The algorithm uses machine learning models such as regression, decision trees. and
artificial neural networks To identify complex patterns and correlations in sentiment and
stock price movements, the system is also designed to dynamically adapt to real-time
market changes with training updates.
Experimental results show that combining feedback data significantly improves prediction accuracy. Compared to traditional methods that rely only on historical price and
volume data, This approach provides practical application for portfolio management.
Risk assessment and automatic trading system Research highlights the increasing importance of unstructured data sources in financial analysis. and proposes a roadmap for
future improvements, such as integrating sector-specific sentiment models and crossmarket analysis.
